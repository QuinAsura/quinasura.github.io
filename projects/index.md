* Constructed a omni-directional modular robotics platform designed and implemented using rapid proto- typing techniques.
* Gesture Based Manual Control of the robot was established using RGBD camera though hand detection and tracking (Nite 2.0) (Open Ni 2.2).
* Head Tracking for Virtual Reality was achieved using on-board sensors on the phone to control the stepper-motor on the omnipresence robot.
