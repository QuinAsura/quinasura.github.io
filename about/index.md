> “Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible” 

This quote by [`Richard
               Feynman`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), is primarily
responsible for my quest for experiencing the **aha** moment in every concept I
learn. The pure romance of **modeling** a physical systems in its entirety,
**realising** it from scratch and **orchestrating** it to any desired
eventuality through **code** is my addiction. 

I have completed my undergrad at SSN College of Engineering `(2011-2015)`
majoring in  **Electrical and Electronics** and currently a Embedded Bluetooth Engineer at Visteon Chennai.

I worked under the guidance of [`Dr.M.Senthil Kumaran`](http://zentill.erfssn.org/) in his kickass lab at SSNCE where I had the leeway to explore and pursue my interests. 

I am also one of the core members of [`Electrical Research Fraternity`](http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/). Follow the [link](http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/) to have a look at our achievements.

I script in nearly in all computer languages but **python** and **c++** remains
close to my heart because one has a short prototyping time and the other oozes performance.

During my free time I usually blog, read *manga* or practise [`Silambam`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silambam). To know more about me have a look at my [`resume`]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf) or ping me at sibi dot vasank @gmail.com.
